# github-actions-quickstart

feedback 1: The documentation is super clear and easy to follow. I like that no steps are skipped, and they are numbered clearly. 
 I did want more details about what GitHub Actions are/do at the high level. I don't want to click on a ton of links to make this make sense. I want the information I need to be here.
